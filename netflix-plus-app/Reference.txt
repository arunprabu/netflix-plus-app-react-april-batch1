==========


 
Thinking in React
---
 0. Find out the number of components 
 1. Break UI into component hierarchy

Components
--------- 
  * Reusable block of code 
  * made up of JS, JSX and CSS (optional)
  
  1. Functional Components  (shared comps should be created in src/components )
      * coded with functions 
      1.1 Functional Components with Named Function [DONE]
      1.2 Functional Components with Anonymous Function [DONE]
      1.3 Functional Components with Arrow Function [DONE] [RECOMMENDED]

      Till v16.7 (before 2018)
      ----  
        * fn components did not have state. 
        * fn components did not have lifecycle hooks

      After v16.8 (after 2018)
      ----
        * fn components can have state. 
        * fn components can have life cycle hooks kind of alternatives. 

  2. Class Components   (shared class components should be created in src/containers )
      * coded as Object oriented class 
      * will have lifecycle hooks 


JSX Limitations
---
  * it will look like HTML. But not HTML 
  * you can use any html tag in JSX. But certain attributes would differ. 
  * JSX elements must be closed. either self-closed, or separately closed 
  * class attribute should become className

Data Binding 
---
  * keep the data in a variable inside a component and display it in JSX of the comp 

  1. One Way Binding [DONE]
      * JSX can merely display the data of the variable. 

  2. Two Way Binding 
      * keep the data in a variable and display it in JSX 
        then, update the data in a variable and see the changes in JSX 

Cross Component Communication / Sharing data b/w components 
--------------------
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication
      Using Props 

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      Using Props with callback fn and event handler
  
  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      3.1 Using React Context API (after 2019 -- React JS v16.8)
      3.2 Using ReduxJS / Flux / MobX 


Concepts
-------
  Data Binding [PARTIALLY]
  Props [DONE]
  States [DONE]
  Events [DONE]
  Lists and Keys [DONE]
  Conditionals [DONE]

3 Ways to integrate bootstrap 
--
  1. original bootstrap 
      https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/
  2. react-bootstrap
      npm i react-bootstrap
  3. reactstrap 
      npm i reactstrap 

Naming Conventions & Casing 
----
  Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 
        * all react components should be named in PascalCase
        * all components folder should be of this type 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html or JSX elements 

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names (if not react), assets in front end projects 
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says okay

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;


Types of Languages based on Data Typing 
---
  1. Strictly-Typed / Strongly-Typed Languages 
      Examples: Java, C#, TypeScript 
      -----
        String myName = "Arun"; // valid
        myName = true; // compilation error
        
  2. Loosely-Typed / Dynamically-Typed Languages
      Examples: JavaScript, PHP, Python
      ------
        var myName = "Arun";  // valid 
        myName = true; // valid 
        myName = 100; // valid 
        myName = []; // valid 
        myName = {}; // valid 
        myName = undefined; // valid 
        myName = null; // valid 


Static Typechecking in ReactJS 
----
  1. TypeScript  (.tsx)
  2. FlowJS (.js)
  3. PropTypes 


How to Setup ESLint and also prettier?
=========
  Step 1: 
    npm i eslint -D 
  
  Step 2: 
    try the following command 
      npx eslint --init 
      or 
      You can also run this command directly using 'npm init @eslint/config'.

    to create .eslintrc.json 
  
  Step 3:
  --
    we can setup the rules or inherit from standard rules

  Step 4: 
  --
    we can setup prettier now... 
    create .prettierrc.json file in root folder 

    then, have the formatting rules in it 
 
    {
      "singleQuote": true,
      "trailingComma": "none"
    }

    Then, start formatiing.

    Also refer for more of prettier config here 
    https://medium.com/@frontend-newbie/integrating-prettier-with-eslint-for-your-create-react-app-in-vscode-153ebe89c1a2
    

  Step 5: 
  ---
    linting will show error in App.test.js file 
    We have to tell eslint to understand that our project has jest in it. 

    open .eslintrc.json and have the following in it 
    "env": {
      "browser": true,
      "es2021": true,
      "jest": true /// This line is needed to fix the error around JEST codes in App.test.js 
    },

  Step 6: 
  ----
  There will be a warning related to react version during linting.
  Fix it by having the following in .eslintrc.json file 

  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "detect"
    }
  }

  That's it. It's over!!!

/* Ways to make REST API Calls in JS
  1. using AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)    -- Native JS
  2. using promised based fetch api (introduced in 2015  -- Native JS)
  3. using axios (third-party)

Introduction to Cases [DONE]
Styling in React [DONE]
---
  1. External Styling
      * external css from third party (ex: bootstrap)
      * our own external css 

  2. Internal Styling 
  3. Inline Styling 

Two Way Binding [DONE]
Life Cycle Hooks [DONE]

Routing [DONE]
-----
  Step 1:
  ------
    npm i react-router-dom

  Step 2: 
  -----
    Identify the Menus and the URLs

    Home                http://localhost:3001/
    About Us            http://localhost:3001/about-us 
    Contact Us          http://localhost:3001/contact-us

  Step 3: 
  ----  
    Setup the Menus with proper URLs in MenuList.js 

  Step 4:
  ----
    Identifing what comp should be loaded when I the following URL. 

    http://localhost:3001/                   --> HomePage 
    http://localhost:3001/about-us           --> AboutUsPage 
    http://localhost:3001/contact-us         --> ContactUsPage 

    Let's create the necessary components for the URLs 

  Step 5:
  -----
    Config the Routes in App.js 
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <Header></Header>

        <main className="container mt-5 pt-2">
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />}></Route>
            <Route path="/about-us" element={<AboutUsPage />}></Route>
            <Route path="/contact-us" element={<ContactUsPage />}></Route>
          </Routes>
        </main>

        <Footer />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>

  Step 6:
  -----
    Let's replace <a href=''> with <Link to=''> in MenuList.js
