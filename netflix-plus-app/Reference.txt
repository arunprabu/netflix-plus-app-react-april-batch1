Thinking in React
---
 0. Find out the number of components 
 1. Break UI into component hierarchy 

Components
--------- 
  * Reusable block of code 
  * made up of JS, JSX and CSS (optional)
  
  1. Functional Components  (should be created in src/components )
      * coded with functions 
      1.1 Functional Components with Named Function [DONE]
      1.2 Functional Components with Anonymous Function [DONE]
      1.3 Functional Components with Arrow Function [DONE] [RECOMMENDED]

  2. Class Components   (should be created in src/containers )
      * coded as Object oriented class 

JSX Limitations
---
  * it will look like HTML. But not HTML 
  * you can use any html tag in JSX. But certain attributes would differ. 
  * JSX elements must be closed. either self-closed, or separately closed 
  * class attribute should become className

Data Binding 
---
  * keep the data in a variable inside a component and display it in JSX of the comp 

  1. One Way Binding [DONE]
      * JSX can merely display the data of the variable. 

  2. Two Way Binding
      * keep the data in a variable and display it in JSX 
        then, update the data in a variable and see the changes in JSX 

Cross Component Communication / Sharing data b/w components 
--------------------
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication
      Using Props 

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      Using Props with callback fn and event handler
  
  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      3.1 Using React Context API (after 2019 -- React JS v16.8)
      3.2 Using ReduxJS / Flux / MobX 


Concepts
-------
  Data Binding 
  Props 
  States 
  Events 
  Lists and Keys 
  Conditionals
